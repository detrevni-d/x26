# All defects model
- we have fmmd only and all defects model.
- for each we have a v32 and v34 model.

so in total we have 4 models to train. 

## steps
- create txt files `train_val_test.ipynb`. these are already created for u and only use if it is required. 
- create masks and images `create_ds_defects.ipynb`
- create a config file for each model at `hexray25/configs`
- train the model.
